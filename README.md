What is it? 
This is a gallery app created for my computer science class

How does it work?
It is very simple. It accesses media storage and displays all the images in a scrolling grid view

What principles are learned?
Permission requesting, external file storage reading, image views, image listeners, and RecyclerViews

Other notes:
Unfortunately it does not work. The permission for reading from external files does not appear in the system dialog that allows the user to grant the access.
I created it while following along with this video. https://youtu.be/iZYLarknOvg?si=bgbELvWBu88_0m_X
